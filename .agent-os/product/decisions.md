## 2025-09-09: Initial Product Planning

**ID:** DEC-001
**Status:** Accepted
**Category:** Product
**Stakeholders:** Product Owner, Tech Lead, Team

### Decision

Agentic Social will be developed as a voice-first social media automation system targeting marketing teams, agencies, content creators, and businesses. The system will leverage MCP-based AI agents for intelligent content creation, real-time competitive analysis, and brand management through natural voice interactions with multi-modal content generation capabilities.

### Context

The social media management market is saturated with GUI-based tools that create workflow friction and require significant manual intervention. Current solutions fail to provide real-time competitive intelligence, unified multi-modal content generation, or natural language control of complex automation workflows. There's a clear market opportunity for a voice-first approach that can dramatically reduce the complexity of social media management while providing advanced AI-powered insights.

### Alternatives Considered

1. **Traditional GUI-Based Social Media Tool**
   - Pros: Familiar interface patterns, established market expectations, easier initial development
   - Cons: Workflow friction, limited accessibility, complex feature discovery, scalability limitations

2. **Text-Only AI Social Media Assistant**
   - Pros: Simpler implementation, focused scope, lower technical complexity
   - Cons: Limited content types, no voice interaction, missing competitive intelligence, restricted automation capabilities

3. **Enterprise-Only B2B Solution**
   - Pros: Higher revenue per customer, focused feature set, clearer market positioning
   - Cons: Limited market size, longer sales cycles, higher customer acquisition costs, reduced viral potential

### Rationale

The voice-first approach with MCP-based AI agents provides several strategic advantages:
- **Accessibility**: Natural language interaction removes technical barriers for non-technical users
- **Scalability**: Voice commands can control complex multi-step workflows more efficiently than GUI interactions
- **Differentiation**: No existing competitor offers true voice-first social media automation
- **AI Integration**: MCP protocol enables modular AI agent architecture for specialized tasks
- **Multi-Modal Content**: Kie.ai integration provides unified content generation across all media types
- **Real-Time Intelligence**: Competitive monitoring and trend analysis provide significant strategic advantages

### Consequences

**Positive:**
- Market differentiation through innovative voice-first interface
- Reduced user onboarding complexity through natural language interactions
- Scalable automation capabilities that grow with user needs
- Advanced AI integration providing competitive intelligence advantages
- Multi-modal content generation addressing complete content creation needs

**Negative:**
- Higher technical complexity requiring advanced voice processing and AI integration
- Dependency on external APIs (ElevenLabs, MCP protocols, Kie.ai) for core functionality
- User adoption curve for voice-first interfaces in professional settings
- Increased infrastructure costs for real-time processing and AI operations

## 2025-09-09: Technical Architecture Decisions

**ID:** DEC-002
**Status:** Accepted
**Category:** Technical
**Stakeholders:** Tech Lead, Engineering Team

### Decision

Adopt a modern full-stack TypeScript architecture with Node.js 20 + Express.js backend, Next.js 14 frontend, PostgreSQL 15 + Redis 7 for data persistence, and AWS ECS containerized deployment with Cloudflare R2 for asset storage.

### Context

The system requires real-time capabilities for voice processing, AI agent coordination, and live dashboard updates. The architecture must support high concurrency for voice interactions, efficient AI model integration via MCP protocol, and scalable multi-modal content generation.

### Rationale

- **TypeScript Full-Stack**: Ensures type safety across the entire application stack
- **Node.js 20**: Latest LTS with excellent performance for real-time applications
- **PostgreSQL 15**: Robust relational database for structured data with JSON support for flexible schemas
- **Redis 7**: High-performance caching and session management for real-time features
- **Next.js 14**: Server-side rendering with App Router for optimal performance and SEO
- **AWS ECS**: Containerized deployment with auto-scaling capabilities
- **Socket.io**: Real-time bidirectional communication for voice rooms and live updates

### Consequences

**Positive:**
- Type-safe development across entire stack reducing runtime errors
- Excellent real-time performance for voice and live updates
- Scalable cloud infrastructure with container orchestration
- Modern development patterns with server-side rendering

**Negative:**
- Higher infrastructure costs compared to simpler deployment options
- Complex deployment pipeline requiring container expertise
- Multiple external service dependencies increasing operational complexity
